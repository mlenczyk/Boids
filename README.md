# Boids
Flocking simulation - work in progress.

Current features:
- Alignment
- Cohesion
- Separation
- Wall avoidance
- Obstacle avoidance

## Obstacles
LMB - place an obstacle
RMB - delete an obstacle

It works with some precision, so that means if you want to delete an obstacle you don't have to click exactly the obstacle pixel. Also if you have several obstacles close to each other, you will delete all of them in some radius from cursor.
